She was privately educated in mathematics and science by William Frend, William King,[a] and Mary Somerville, the noted 19th-century researcher and scientific author. In the 1840s, the mathematician Augustus De Morgan extended her ""much help in her mathematical studies"" including study of advanced calculus topics including the ""numbers of Bernoulli"" (that formed her celebrated algorithm for Babbage's Analytical Engine).[39] In a letter to Lady Byron, De Morgan suggested that Ada's skill in mathematics might lead her to become ""an original mathematical investigator, perhaps of first-rate eminence"".[40]",35

In making the program Winograd was concerned with the problem of providing a computer with sufficient ""understanding"" to be able to use natural language. Winograd built a blocks world, restricting the program's intellectual world to a simulated ""world of toy blocks"". The program could accept commands such as, ""Find a block which is taller than the one you are holding and put it into the box"" and carry out the requested action using a simulated block-moving  arm. The program could also respond verbally, for example, ""I do not know which block you mean."" The SHRDLU program can be viewed historically as one of the classic examples of how difficult it is for a programmer to build up a computer's semantic memory by hand and how limited or ""brittle"" such programs are.[4]",122
